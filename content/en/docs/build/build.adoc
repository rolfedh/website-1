== Overview.

A `Build` resource allows the user to define:

* source
* sources
* strategy
* params
* builder
* dockerfile
* output
* env

A `Build` is available within a namespace.

== Build Controller

The controller watches for:

* Updates on the `Build` resource (_CRD instance_)

When the controller reconciles it:

* Validates if the referenced `StrategyRef` exists.
* Validates if the specified `params` exists on the referenced strategy parameters. It also validates if the `params` names collide with the Shipwright reserved names.
* Validates if the container `registry` output secret exists.
* Validates if the referenced `spec.source.url` endpoint exists.

== Build Validations

In order to prevent users from triggering `BuildRuns` (_execution of a Build_) that will eventually fail because of wrong or missing dependencies or configuration settings, the Build controller will validate them in advance. If all validations are successful, users can expect a `Succeeded` `Status.Reason`, however if any of the validations failed, users can rely on the `Status.Reason` and `Status.Message` fields, in order to understand the root cause.

|===
| Status.Reason | Description

| BuildStrategyNotFound
| The referenced namespace-scope strategy doesn't exist.

| ClusterBuildStrategyNotFound
| The referenced cluster-scope strategy doesn't exist.

| SetOwnerReferenceFailed
| Setting ownerreferences between a Build and a BuildRun failed. This is triggered when making use of the `build.shipwright.io/build-run-deletion` annotation in a Build.

| SpecSourceSecretRefNotFound
| The secret used to authenticate to git doesn't exist.

| SpecOutputSecretRefNotFound
| The secret used to authenticate to the container registry doesn't exist.

| SpecBuilderSecretRefNotFound
| The secret used to authenticate to the container registry doesn't exist.

| MultipleSecretRefNotFound
| More than one secret is missing. At the moment, only three paths on a Build can specify a secret.

| RestrictedParametersInUse
| One or many defined `params` are colliding with Shipwright reserved parameters. See <<defining-params,Defining Params>> for more information.

| UndefinedParameter
| One or many defined `params` are not defined in the referenced strategy. Please ensure that the strategy defines them under its `spec.parameters` list.

| RemoteRepositoryUnreachable
| The defined `spec.source.url` was not found. This validation only take place for http/https protocols.

| BuildNameInvalid
| The defined `Build` name (`metadata.name`) is invalid. The `Build` name should be a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set[valid label value].

| SpecEnvNameCanNotBeBlank
| Indicates that the name for a user provided environment variable is blank.

| SpecEnvValueCanNotBeBlank
| Indicates that the value for a user provided environment variable is blank.
|===

== Configuring a Build

The `Build` definition supports the following fields:

* Required:
 ** https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#required-fields[`apiVersion`] - Specifies the API version, for example `shipwright.io/v1alpha1`.
 ** https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#required-fields[`kind`] - Specifies the Kind type, for example `Build`.
 ** https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#required-fields[`metadata`] - Metadata that identify the CRD instance, for example the name of the `Build`.
 ** `spec.source.URL` - Refers to the Git repository containing the source code.
 ** `spec.strategy` - Refers to the `BuildStrategy` to be used, see the link:../samples/buildstrategy[examples]
 ** `spec.builder.image` - Refers to the image containing the build tools to build the source code. (_Use this path for Dockerless strategies, this is just required for `source-to-image` buildStrategy_)
 ** `spec.output`- Refers to the location where the generated image would be pushed.
 ** `spec.output.credentials.name`- Reference an existing secret to get access to the container registry.
* Optional:
 ** `spec.paramValues` - Refers to a list of `key/value` that could be used to loosely type `parameters` in the `BuildStrategy`.
 ** `spec.dockerfile` - Path to a Dockerfile to be used for building an image. (_Use this path for strategies that require a Dockerfile_)
 ** `spec.sources` - <<Sources,Sources>> describes a slice of artifacts that will be imported into project context, before the actual build process starts.
 ** `spec.timeout` - Defines a custom timeout. The value needs to be parsable by https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration[ParseDuration], for example `5m`. The default is ten minutes. The value can be overwritten in the `BuildRun`.
 ** `metadata.annotations[build.shipwright.io/build-run-deletion]` - Defines if delete all related BuildRuns when deleting the Build. The default is `false`.
 ** `spec.output.annotations` - Refers to a list of `key/value` that could be used to https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/annotations.md[annotate] the output image.
 ** `spec.output.labels` - Refers to a list of `key/value` that could be used to label the output image.
 ** `spec.env` - Specifies additional environment variables that should be passed to the build container. The available variables depend on the tool that is being used by the chosen build strategy.

=== Defining the Source

A `Build` resource can specify a Git source, together with other parameters like:

* `source.credentials.name` - For private repositories, the name is a reference to an existing secret on the same namespace containing the `ssh` data.
* `source.revision` - An specific revision to select from the source repository, this can be a commit, tag or branch name. If not defined, it will fallback to the git repository default branch.
* `source.contextDir` - For repositories where the source code is not located at the root folder, you can specify this path here.

By default, the Build controller won't validate that the Git repository exists. If the validation is desired, users can define the `build.shipwright.io/verify.repository` annotation with `true` explicitly. For example:

Example of a `Build` with the *build.shipwright.io/verify.repository* annotation, in order to enable the `spec.source.url` validation.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: buildah-golang-build
  annotations:
    build.shipwright.io/verify.repository: "true"
spec:
  source:
    url: https://github.com/shipwright-io/sample-go
    contextDir: docker-build
----

NOTE: The Build controller only validates two scenarios. The first one where the endpoint uses an `http/https` protocol, the second one when a `ssh` protocol (_e.g. `git@`_) is defined and none referenced secret was provided(_e.g. source.credentials.name_).

Example of a `Build` with a source with *credentials* defined by the user.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: buildpack-nodejs-build
spec:
  source:
    url: https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex
    credentials:
      name: source-repository-credentials
----

Example of a `Build` with a source that specifies an specific subfolder on the repository.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: buildah-custom-context-dockerfile
spec:
  source:
    url: https://github.com/SaschaSchwarze0/npm-simple
    contextDir: renamed
----

Example of a `Build` that specifies the tag `v.0.1.0` for the git repository:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: buildah-golang-build
spec:
  source:
    url: https://github.com/shipwright-io/sample-go
    contextDir: docker-build
    revision: v0.1.0
----

Example of a `Build` that specifies environment variables:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: buildah-golang-build
spec:
  source:
    url: https://github.com/shipwright-io/sample-go
    contextDir: docker-build
  env:
    - name: EXAMPLE_VAR_1
      value: "example-value-1"
    - name: EXAMPLE_VAR_2
      value: "example-value-2"
----

Example of a `Build` that uses the Kubernetes Downward API to
expose a `Pod` field as an environment variable:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: buildah-golang-build
spec:
  source:
    url: https://github.com/shipwright-io/sample-go
    contextDir: docker-build
  env:
    - name: POD_NAME
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: metadata.name
----

Example of a `Build` that uses the Kubernetes Downward API to
expose a `Container` field as an environment variable:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: buildah-golang-build
spec:
  source:
    url: https://github.com/shipwright-io/sample-go
    contextDir: docker-build
  env:
    - name: MEMORY_LIMIT
      valueFrom:
        resourceFieldRef:
          containerName: my-container
          resource: limits.memory
----

=== Defining the Strategy

A `Build` resource can specify the `BuildStrategy` to use, these are:

* link:/docs/api/buildstrategies/#buildah[Buildah]
* link:/docs/api/buildstrategies/#buildpacks-v3[Buildpacks-v3]
* link:/docs/api/buildstrategies/#buildkit[BuildKit]
* link:/docs/api/buildstrategies/#kaniko[Kaniko]
* link:/docs/api/buildstrategies/#ko[ko]
* link:/docs/api/buildstrategies/#source-to-image[Source-to-Image]

Defining the strategy is straightforward, you need to define the `name` and the `kind`. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: buildpack-nodejs-build
spec:
  strategy:
    name: buildpacks-v3
    kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
----

=== Defining ParamValues

A `Build` resource can specify _params_, these allow users to modify the behaviour of the referenced `BuildStrategy` steps.

When using _params_, users should avoid:

* Defining a `spec.paramValues` name that doesn't match one of the `spec.parameters` defined in the `BuildStrategy`.
* Defining a `spec.paramValues` name that collides with the Shipwright reserved parameters. These are _BUILDER_IMAGE_,_DOCKERFILE_,_CONTEXT_DIR_ and any name starting with _shp-_.

In general, _params_ are tighly bound to Strategy _parameters_, please make sure you understand the contents of your strategy of choice, before defining _params_ in the _Build_. `BuildRun` resources allow users to override `Build` _params_, see the related link:./buildrun.md#defining-params[docs] for more information.

==== Example

The following `BuildStrategy` contains a single step ( _a-strategy-step_ ) with a command and arguments. The strategy defines a parameter( _sleep-time_ ) with a reasonable default, that is used in the step arguments, see _$(params.sleep-time)_.

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: BuildStrategy
metadata:
  name: sleepy-strategy
spec:
  parameters:
  - name: sleep-time
    description: "time in seconds for sleeping"
    default: "1"
  buildSteps:
  - name: a-strategy-step
    image: alpine:latest
    command:
    - sleep
    args:
    - $(params.sleep-time)
----

If users would like the above strategy to change its behaviour, e.g. _allow the step to trigger a sleep cmd longer than 1 second_, then users can modify the default behaviour, via their `Build` `spec.paramValues` definition. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: a-build
spec:
  source:
    url: https://github.com/shipwright-io/sample-go
    contextDir: docker-build/
  paramValues:
  - name: sleep-time
    value: "60"
  strategy:
    name: sleepy-strategy
    kind: BuildStrategy
----

The above `Build` definition uses _sleep-time_ param, a well-defined _parameter_ under its referenced `BuildStrategy`. By doing this, the user signalizes to the referenced sleepy-strategy, the usage of a different value for its _sleep-time_ parameter.

=== Defining the Builder or Dockerfile

A `Build` resource can specify an image containing the tools to build the final image. Users can do this via the `spec.builder` or the `spec.dockerfile`. For example, the user choose  the `Dockerfile` file under the source repository.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: buildah-golang-build
spec:
  source:
    url: https://github.com/shipwright-io/sample-go
    contextDir: docker-build
  strategy:
    name: buildah
    kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
  dockerfile: Dockerfile
----

Another example, when the user chooses to use a `builder` image ( This is required for `source-to-image` buildStrategy, because for different code languages, they have different builders. ):

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: s2i-nodejs-build
spec:
  source:
    url: https://github.com/shipwright-io/sample-nodejs
    contextDir: source-build/
  strategy:
    name: source-to-image
    kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
  builder:
    image: docker.io/centos/nodejs-10-centos7
----

=== Defining the Output

A `Build` resource can specify the output where the image should be pushed. For external private registries it is recommended to specify a secret with the related data to access it. There is an option available to specify the annotation and labels for the output image (annotations and labels mentioned here are specific to the container image and do not have any relation with the `Build` annotations).

*NOTE*: When you specify annotations or labels, the output image will get pushed twice. The first push comes from the build strategy. A follow-on update will then change the image configuration to add the annotations and labels. If you have automation in place based on push events in your container registry, be aware of this behavior.

For example, the user specify a public registry:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: s2i-nodejs-build
spec:
  source:
    url: https://github.com/shipwright-io/sample-nodejs
    contextDir: source-build/
  strategy:
    name: source-to-image
    kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
  builder:
    image: docker.io/centos/nodejs-10-centos7
  output:
    image: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/build-examples/nodejs-ex
----

Another example, is when the user specifies a private registry:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: s2i-nodejs-build
spec:
  source:
    url: https://github.com/shipwright-io/sample-nodejs
    contextDir: source-build/
  strategy:
    name: source-to-image
    kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
  builder:
    image: docker.io/centos/nodejs-10-centos7
  output:
    image: us.icr.io/source-to-image-build/nodejs-ex
    credentials:
      name: icr-knbuild
----

Example of user specifies image annotations and labels:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: s2i-nodejs-build
spec:
  source:
    url: https://github.com/shipwright-io/sample-nodejs
    contextDir: source-build/
  strategy:
    name: source-to-image
    kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
  builder:
    image: docker.io/centos/nodejs-10-centos7
  output:
    image: us.icr.io/source-to-image-build/nodejs-ex
    credentials:
      name: icr-knbuild
    annotations:
      "org.opencontainers.image.source": "https://github.com/org/repo"
      "org.opencontainers.image.url": "https://my-company.com/images"
    labels:
      "maintainer": "team@my-company.com"
      "description": "This is my cool image"
----

Annotations added to the output image can be verified by running the command:

[source,terminal]
----
  docker manifest inspect us.icr.io/source-to-image-build/nodejs-ex | jq ".annotations"
----

Labels added to the output image can be verified by running the command (image should be available in host machine):

[source,terminal]
----
  docker inspect us.icr.io/source-to-image-build/nodejs-ex | jq ".[].Config.Labels"
----

=== Sources

Represents remote artifacts, as in external entities that will be added to the build context before the actual build starts. Therefore, you may employ `.spec.sources` to download artifacts from external repositories.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: nodejs-ex
spec:
  sources:
    - name: project-logo
      url: https://gist.github.com/project/image.png
----

Under `.spec.sources` we have the following attributes:

* `.name`: represents the name of resource, required attribute.
* `.url`: universal resource location (URL), required attribute.

When downloading artifacts the process is executed in the same directory where the application source-code is located, by default `/workspace/source`.

Additionally, we have plan to keep evolving `.spec.sources` by adding more types of remote data declaration, this API field works as an extension point to support external and internal resource locations.

At this initial stage, authentication is not supported therefore you can only download from sources without this mechanism in place.

== BuildRun deletion

A `Build` can automatically delete a related `BuildRun`. To enable this feature set the  `build.shipwright.io/build-run-deletion` annotation to `true` in the `Build` instance. By default the annotation is never present in a `Build` definition. See an example of how to define this annotation:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: kaniko-golang-build
  annotations:
    build.shipwright.io/build-run-deletion: "true"
----
